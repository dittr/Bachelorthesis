  \begin{itemize}
   \item<1-> Different approaches for image-/video-prediction were discussed
   \item<2-> The choice of the recurrent module is important for the performance of the network
   \item<3-> The results showed, how important HP optimization is to achieve state-of-the-art performance and that without, having a more complex sub-module
   is not the key
   \item<4-> For future experiments, it would be nice to have all $18$ experiments performed with HP optimization to get the overall results
  \end{itemize}
