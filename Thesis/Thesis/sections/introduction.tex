\section{Introduction} \label{section::introduction} 
 The key of this work is to get an overview of different state-of-the-art solutions for image-/video-prediction and to
 understand the importance of the right choice of the recurrent sub-module for image-/video-prediction algorithms. Therefore this thesis
 gives an overview of different state-of-the-art solutions for image-/video-prediction and implements different algorithms as baselines to change the used recurrent
 sub-module with a more advanced recurrent sub-module. 
 An important part of the work is the implementation of the chosen baseline networks in PyTorch.
 This implementation is used to perform the experiments on.
