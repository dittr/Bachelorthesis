% Abstract
This thesis compares different state-of-the-art solutions for image prediction. Key aspect of the work is the comparison of different versions
of the ConvLSTM \cite{Shi2015}. To be able to compare those different versions, an image prediction architecture, more explicit PredNet \cite{Lotter2016}, is implemented as baseline architecture.
This architecture uses the ConvLSTM module as recurrent sub-module. This sub-module is then changed during the experiments with another implementation (PredRNN \cite{Wang2017}). Other comparisons
are then performed theoretically The thesis introduces the reader about image prediction,
convolutional LSTM's and other necessary parts to be able to follow. It then describes the PredNet architecture and idea and how this differs from other image prediction architectures. Then the
performed experiments are described in-depth. Afterwards it gives a comprehensive discussion part, where the different sub-module performances are discussed very deeply, to understand the
experimental results. Lastly there is a conclusion, which sums everything up.
